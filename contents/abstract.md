🧠 Abstract — Tired of the Negativity?

If you moderate or participate in an online community, you’ve felt it.

One day things are calm.
The next, hostile comments pour in, negative links multiply, and your community becomes a target.

Moderation tools react after the damage is done — but what if communities could anticipate attacks, recognize escalation patterns, and choose responses that actually work?

In this data story, we study Reddit as a network of communities under constant pressure. We track waves of negativity, identify where attacks originate, and — most importantly — analyze which defense strategies help communities recover without fueling future hostility.

This isn’t about blaming users.
It’s about helping communities protect themselves.

🎯 Why Study This?

Online negativity doesn’t stay local. It spreads: across neighboring communities, through repeated offenders, and in synchronized waves triggered by real-world events.
Yet most communities rely on instinct and perhaps emotion when responding.
We ask a different question: what does the data say we should do? 
So let’s see how you can best protect your community.

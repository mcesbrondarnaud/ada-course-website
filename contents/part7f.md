# 🛡️ VI. Defending the Community: What Actually Reduces Negativity?
We’re starting to get a pretty solid understanding of negativity flows; both origins and high spreading points. So we can finally start to think about how to reduce and deflect it.
Stopping negativity may seem easy — just censor the sources. Removing them kills the peaks already.

But communities don’t want silence. Likewise, we can’t just cut off from world events.
Therefore we need a strategy for recovery. Luckily for you, there are concrete actions you can take to protect your own community.

Let’s see what the data says; We focus on victims of negativity, not attackers, and evaluate how a subreddit’s response affects future incoming hostility. 
As community users, there are not many actions at your disposal; you can choose how much you engage in content, and you can control the tone of your posts. We thus characterize defense strategies along two dimensions: 

Posture: how much activity changes after an attack
Discipline: how hostile outgoing interactions become

We measure success of strategies as relative reduction in received negativity after a spike, and find:

=> Many interesting combinations ; If you want an easier strategy, varying only one factor, you should focus on posture

The most effective defense is neither retreat nor retaliation — it is measured resistance.

Lisa’s finger hovers over the keyboard.
Her subreddit is under attack. Threads are flooding in. Insults pile up. The instinct is immediate: fight back.

Ban the attackers.
Reply sharply.
Launch a counter-raid.

*“Wait,”* the analyst says calmly. *“Before you act — we tested every option.”*

### Choosing a Response: What Communities Actually Do

The first chart summarizes the defense strategies observed across thousands of conflict episodes. When faced with an incoming wave of negativity, communities tend to adopt one of a few recurring behaviors:
- Aggressive response: replying with hostility, public confrontations, bans, or counter-attacks
- Neutral response: staying active but refusing to engage emotionally
- Retreat: reducing posting activity, locking threads, or temporarily disengaging
- Mixed strategies: combinations of the above

The distribution shows that retaliation is common — and understandable. When attacked, most communities instinctively push back.

*“But instinct,”* the analyst notes, *“is not strategy.”*

### What Actually Works

</div>

The second visualization evaluates which strategies lead to successful de-escalation. Success is measured as a rapid reduction in incoming negativity following the response.

The results are unambiguous:
- Aggressive responses consistently perform the worst. Conflicts last longer and escalate further when hostility is met with hostility.
- Neutrality alone helps, but only marginally.
- The most effective defense is a combination:
-   Retreat + Neutrality
-   Reduce exposure.
-   Refuse to provide emotional fuel.

This combination short-circuits the feedback loop. Without reactions, attackers lose traction.

*“You don’t win by shouting louder,”* the analyst explains. *“You win by removing the stage.”*

### Measuring the Gain: Against Doing Nothing

The final chart compares each strategy against a baseline control group: communities that did nothing at all.

This makes the conclusion unavoidable:
- Retreat + Neutrality outperforms the control case by a wide margin
- Aggressive responses perform worse than doing nothing
- Even partial disengagement improves recovery speed

In other words:
**Fighting back doesn’t just fail — it actively makes things worse.**

### The Verdict

Lisa looks at the screen.
The numbers don’t lie.

Fighting back feels satisfying — but it extends the war.
Silence feels passive — but it saves the community.

*“It’s the oldest rule of the internet,”* the analyst says quietly. *“Don’t feed the trolls.”*

Lisa exhales.

*“Lock the threads,”* she orders. *“Automod on high alert. No replies. We weather the storm.”*

And for the first time since the attack began, the hostility curve starts to fall.

  <h4 class="mb-2">Key takeaway</h4>
  <p class="mb-0">
    The best defense against online negativity is not confrontation, but disengagement.
    Data confirms that reducing exposure and refusing to engage is the fastest path to recovery.

# Chapter VI - The Counter-Measure (Don't Feed the Trolls)
Lisa’s finger hovers over the keyboard. Her subreddit is burning. The instinct to fight back is overwhelming. She wants to ban the attackers, reply to their comments, and launch a counter-raid.

*"Wait!"* the analyst shouts, grabbing her wrist. *"Don't engage."*

*"They are destroying my community,"* Lisa snaps. *"I have to do something."*

*"We analyzed the outcome of every major conflict strategy,"* the analyst says, projecting the final, most crucial chart of the war. *"We looked at what happens when victims fight back versus when they disengage."*

The data reveals a stark truth about Reddit warfare.
<ul>
<li> <strong>The Counter-Attack (Aggressive Response):</strong> When moderators or communities retaliate with hostility, the conflict duration extends and the intensity spikes. You aren't putting out the fire; you are pouring gasoline on it.</li>
<li> <strong>The Shield Wall (Retreat + Neutral):</strong> The strategy of "Retreat" (reducing activity) combined with "Neutrality" (refusing to engage in toxic comments) results in the fastest de-escalation.</li>
</ul>

*"It's the oldest rule of the internet,"* the analyst whispers. *"Don't Feed The Trolls. But now, we have the math to prove it."*

Lisa looks at the screen. The math is undeniable. Fighting back satisfies the ego but destroys the subreddit. Silence saves the community.

She takes a deep breath... and takes her hands off the keyboard.

*"Lock the threads,"* she orders. *"Automod on high alert. No replies. We weather the storm."*

# Chapter IV: The Spark (Internal Drama or Global Chaos?)

Lisa stares at the data. *"I understand the Echo Chambers. But what pulls the trigger? Do they wake up angry, or does something happen in the real world to set them off?"*

The analyst nods. *"The 'External Trigger' theory. Does a terrorist attack in Paris or a political scandal in Washington cause a spike in hostility on Reddit?"*

To answer this, the team activated the **GDELT Interface**, cross-referencing global news events with Reddit hostility spikes from 2015 to 2017.

**The Insight:** The Bubble Plot acts as our "Event Radar."
- **The Synchronized Spikes:** Some major events (like the Paris Attacks or specific Election Debates) show a clear correlation: Real-world tragedy leads to immediate online hostility.
- **The Selective Sensitivity:** Interestingly, some events induce huge reactions on some subs while others are completely insensitive.
-   Example: The condemning of Jared Fogle (Subway spokesman) for possession of child pornography passed mostly unnoticed by the world, but caused one of the largest hostility spikes in history on the AdultContentcluster.
- **The False Alarms:** Conversely, some unexpected correlations appear to be pure coincidence.
-   Example: The Gaming cluster shows a massive spike corresponding to COP 21 and "Black Lives Matter." Is Gaming suddenly politically active? Unlikely. A closer look reveals this spike actually aligns with Konami banning Hideo Kojima during the Game Awards. The date matched; the cause did not.


*"So it's not just a mirror of the news,"* Lisa concludes.
*"It's more complex,"* the analyst replies. *"We calculated exactly how much the 'Media Tone' influences Reddit."*

**The Analysis:**
- **Result:** While specific massive events do trigger waves, the vast majority of Reddit conflict is endogenous. It is drama generated by Reddit, for Reddit. The external world sets the mood, but the spark is local in most communities.

**1. Data Engineering & The GDELT 2.0 Shift**
Processing the GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) dataset required handling massive scale updates (every 15 minutes). We utilized **Google BigQuery** to perform server-side aggregations via SQL, filtering specifically for event types likely to trigger social friction (terrorist attacks, political scandals, social protests).
* *Constraint:* We restricted our analysis to the period starting **March 2015**. This marks the transition from GDELT 1.0 to **GDELT 2.0**, where the data reporting structure changed significantly. Using data prior to this date would have introduced feature discontinuities.
**2. Metric Selection: Goldstein vs. AvgTone**
A major challenge was mapping geopolitical events to social sentiment.
* **The Failure of Goldstein:** We initially tested the *Goldstein Scale*, which measures stability between state actors. However, this metric failed to capture social polarization. For example, a controversial election might be geopolitically "stable" (Goldstein $\approx$ 0) but socially explosive.
* **The Solution (AvgTone):** We settled on the `AvgTone` metric, which quantifies the emotional tone of the reporting journalist. This proved to be a stronger proxy for the "public mood" than state-level stability metrics.
**3. Normalization: The Rolling Z-Score**
To handle the non-stationarity of Reddit (where user volume grows significantly over years), raw counts of hostile comments were unusable. We applied a **Rolling Z-Score** normalization with a 2-month window.
For a given week **t**, the standardized hostility score **Z<sub>t</sub>** is calculated as: **Z<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub> − μ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>) / σ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>**
Where **x<sub>t</sub>** is the raw hostility volume, and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation over the rolling window $w$. We further filtered for relevance by excluding weeks falling below the 50th percentile in activity volume, preventing low-traffic threads from producing artificial spikes.
**4. Statistical Inference: T-Tests & Granger Causality**
To mathematically validate the link between GDELT (Time series $X$) and Reddit Hostility (Time series $Y$), we employed two tests:
* **Regression T-Tests:** We modeled Reddit hostility as a function of GDELT tone. The heatmap displayed above represents the *t-statistics* of the regression coefficients. A high absolute t-statistic implies that the GDELT variable has a statistically significant non-zero effect on Reddit hostility ($p < 0.05$).
* **Granger Causality Test:** To determine if news *predicts* hostility (rather than just correlating with it), we performed a Granger Causality test. Formally, we tested if including past values of GDELT ($X_{t-k}$) provides a statistically significant reduction in the prediction error of Reddit Hostility ($Y_t$) compared to a model using only past values of Reddit ($Y_{t-k}$):
$$Y_t = \alpha + \sum_{k=1}^L \beta_k Y_{t-k} + \sum_{k=1}^L \gamma_k X_{t-k} + \varepsilon_t$$
We test the null hypothesis $H_0: \gamma_k = 0$ for all lags $k$.
**5. Lag Analysis & Temporal Directionality**
Beyond simple correlation, we analyzed the time-lag between the two signals to determine the direction of the "spark."
* **Standard Reaction (0 to +2 Weeks):** For most event types (Terrorism, Scandals), the reaction is either practically instantaneous or Reddit lags behind GDELT by 1-2 weeks. This confirms the intuitive model where real-world news drives online discussion.
**The Social Protest Anomaly (-1 Week):** Interestingly, for the 'Social Protests' theme, we observed a **negative lag**. In these cases, the Reddit hostility spike often *preceded* the GDELT signal by one week. This suggests that for grassroots movements, the conflict ignites within the community *before* it reaches the threshold of global media coverage. Due to a lack of statistical significance, we chose not to discuss this in our main analysis.

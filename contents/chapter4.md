# Chapter IV - The Spark (Internal Drama or Global Chaos?)

Lisa stares at the data. *"I understand the Echo Chambers. But what pulls the trigger? Do they wake up angry, or does something happen in the real world to set them off?"*

The analyst nods. *"The 'External Trigger' theory. Does a terrorist attack in Paris or a political scandal in Washington cause a spike in hostility on Reddit?"*

To answer this, the team activated the **GDELT Interface**, cross-referencing global news events with Reddit hostility spikes from 2015 to 2017.

**The Insight:** The Bubble Plot acts as our "Event Radar."
- **The Synchronized Spikes:** Some major events (like the Paris Attacks or specific Election Debates) show a clear correlation: Real-world tragedy leads to immediate online hostility.
- **The Selective Sensitivity:** Interestingly, some events induce huge reactions on some subs while others are completely insensitive.
-   Example: The condemning of Jared Fogle (Subway spokesman) for possession of child pornography passed mostly unnoticed by the world, but caused one of the largest hostility spikes in history on the AdultContentcluster.
- **The False Alarms:** Conversely, some unexpected correlations appear to be pure coincidence.
-   Example: The Gaming cluster shows a massive spike corresponding to COP 21 and "Black Lives Matter." Is Gaming suddenly politically active? Unlikely. A closer look reveals this spike actually aligns with Konami banning Hideo Kojima during the Game Awards. The date matched; the cause did not.


*"So it's not just a mirror of the news,"* Lisa concludes.
*"It's more complex,"* the analyst replies. *"We calculated exactly how much the 'Media Tone' influences Reddit."*

**The Analysis:**
- **Result:** While specific massive events do trigger waves, the vast majority of Reddit conflict is endogenous. It is drama generated by Reddit, for Reddit. The external world sets the mood, but the spark is local in most communities.

### 1. Data Engineering & the GDELT 2.0 Shift

Processing the GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) dataset required handling updates at very large scale (events every 15 minutes).  
To manage this volume, we relied on **Google BigQuery** to perform server-side SQL aggregations, focusing on event categories most likely to trigger social tension (terrorist attacks, political scandals, social protests).

**Constraint.**  
We restricted the analysis to data starting in **March 2015**, corresponding to the transition from **GDELT 1.0** to **GDELT 2.0**.  
Including earlier data would have introduced structural inconsistencies due to changes in the reporting pipeline.

### 2. Metric Selection — Goldstein vs. AvgTone

A central challenge was translating geopolitical events into a proxy for *social sentiment*.

- **The limitation of the Goldstein scale.**  
  The Goldstein index measures geopolitical stability between state actors. While useful in international relations, it fails to capture social polarization. For example, a controversial election can be geopolitically “stable” while being socially explosive.

- **Why AvgTone.**  
  We therefore selected **AvgTone**, which measures the emotional tone of media coverage. This metric proved to be a more reliable proxy for the public mood and its potential impact on online hostility.

### 3. Normalization — Rolling Z-Score

Reddit activity is highly non-stationary: user volume and interaction rates increase substantially over time.  
As a result, raw counts of hostile interactions are not directly comparable across periods.

We apply a **rolling Z-score normalization** with a **two-month window**.  
For a given week *t*, the standardized hostility score is defined as:

**Z<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub> − μ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>) / σ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>**

where:
- *x<sub>t</sub>* is the raw hostility volume,
- *μ* and *σ* are the mean and standard deviation over the rolling window *w*.

To avoid spurious spikes driven by low-activity periods, we exclude weeks below the **50th percentile of activity volume**.

---

### 4. Statistical Inference — T-Tests and Granger Causality

To evaluate whether global news dynamics influence Reddit hostility, we use two complementary approaches.

**Regression T-Tests.**  
We regress Reddit hostility on GDELT tone indicators.  
The resulting heatmap displays **p-values**, where smaller values indicate that Reddit hostility and GDELT tone are unlikely to be independent.

**Granger Causality Tests.**  
To test whether news *predicts* hostility (rather than merely correlating with it), we apply a Granger causality framework.  
Formally, we test whether including past values of GDELT improves the prediction of Reddit hostility:

**Y<sub>t</sub> = α + Σ<sub>k=1..L</sub> β<sub>k</sub> · Y<sub>t−k</sub> + Σ<sub>k=1..L</sub> γ<sub>k</sub> · X<sub>t−k</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>**

The null hypothesis is:

**H<sub>0</sub>: γ<sub>k</sub> = 0** for all lags *k*

In practice, while GDELT exhibits limited predictive power overall, only the **Informative – Social Protests** pair yielded a statistically significant result.  
Given the weakness and sparsity of these effects, we chose not to emphasize Granger results in the main narrative.

---

### 5. Lag Analysis & Temporal Directionality

Beyond correlation, we analyze **temporal lags** to identify the direction of influence.

- **Standard reaction (0 to +2 weeks).**  
  For most event types (terrorism, scandals), Reddit hostility reacts either immediately or with a lag of one to two weeks. This aligns with the intuitive model where real-world events drive online discussion.

- **The social protest anomaly (−1 week).**  
  For social protests, we observe a negative lag: Reddit hostility often spikes *before* the corresponding GDELT signal.  
  This suggests that grassroots mobilization and online conflict may precede mainstream media coverage.  
  Due to limited statistical significance, we report this result as a qualitative observation rather than a core finding.

**1. Data Engineering & The GDELT 2.0 Shift**
Processing the GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) dataset required handling massive scale updates (every 15 minutes). We utilized **Google BigQuery** to perform server-side aggregations via SQL, filtering specifically for event types likely to trigger social friction (terrorist attacks, political scandals, social protests).
* *Constraint:* We restricted our analysis to the period starting **March 2015**. This marks the transition from GDELT 1.0 to **GDELT 2.0**, where the data reporting structure changed significantly. Using data prior to this date would have introduced feature discontinuities.
**2. Metric Selection: Goldstein vs. AvgTone**
A major challenge was mapping geopolitical events to social sentiment.
* **The Failure of Goldstein:** We initially tested the *Goldstein Scale*, which measures stability between state actors. However, this metric failed to capture social polarization. For example, a controversial election might be geopolitically "stable" (Goldstein $\approx$ 0) but socially explosive.
* **The Solution (AvgTone):** We settled on the `AvgTone` metric, which quantifies the emotional tone of the reporting journalist. This proved to be a stronger proxy for the "public mood" than state-level stability metrics.
**3. Normalization: The Rolling Z-Score**
To handle the non-stationarity of Reddit (where user volume grows significantly over years), raw counts of hostile comments were unusable. We applied a **Rolling Z-Score** normalization with a 2-month window.
For a given week **t**, the standardized hostility score **Z<sub>t</sub>** is calculated as: **Z<sub>t</sub> = (x<sub>t</sub> − μ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>) / σ<sub>[t−w, t]</sub>**
Where **x<sub>t</sub>** is the raw hostility volume, and **μ** and **σ** are the mean and standard deviation over the rolling window **w**. We further filtered for relevance by excluding weeks falling below the 50th percentile in activity volume, preventing low-traffic threads from producing artificial spikes.
**4. Statistical Inference: T-Tests & Granger Causality**
To mathematically validate the link between GDELT (Time series **X**) and Reddit Hostility (Time series **Y**), we employed two tests:
* **Regression T-Tests:** We modeled Reddit hostility as a function of GDELT tone. The heatmap displayed above represents the resulting *p-values* of the test. A small p-value indicates that GDELT and Reddit are very unlikely to be independent one from another.
* **Granger Causality Test:** To determine if news *predicts* hostility (rather than just correlating with it), we performed a Granger Causality test. Formally, we tested if including past values of GDELT (**X<sub>t-k</sub>**) provides a statistically significant reduction in the prediction error of Reddit Hostility (**Y<sub>t</sub>**) compared to a model using only past values of Reddit (**Y<sub>t-k</sub>**): **Y<sub>t</sub> = α + Σ<sub>k=1..L</sub> β<sub>k</sub> · Y<sub>t−k</sub> + Σ<sub>k=1..L</sub> γ<sub>k</sub> · X<sub>t−k</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>**
We test the null hypothesis **H<sub>0</sub>: γ<sub>k</sub> = 0** for all lags **k**. We chose not to display those results eventhough GDELT seemed to have a small predictive power on Reddit, only the pair Informative - Social-protests yielded a statistically significant p-value.
**5. Lag Analysis & Temporal Directionality**
Beyond simple correlation, we analyzed the time-lag between the two signals to determine the direction of the "spark."
* **Standard Reaction (0 to +2 Weeks):** For most event types (Terrorism, Scandals), the reaction is either practically instantaneous or Reddit lags behind GDELT by 1-2 weeks. This confirms the intuitive model where real-world news drives online discussion.
**The Social Protest Anomaly (-1 Week):** Interestingly, for the 'Social Protests' theme, we observed a **negative lag**. In these cases, the Reddit hostility spike often *preceded* the GDELT signal by one week. This suggests that for grassroots movements, the conflict ignites within the community *before* it reaches the threshold of global media coverage. Due to a lack of statistical significance, we chose not to discuss this in our main analysis.

# V. 📈 Modeling the Spread: Why Simple Propagation Isn’t Enough
We formalize these observations with a propagation model. The goal is to see whether spreaders and world events are sufficient factors to determine the dynamics of negativity.
The best fit combines: local spread factors (community-to-community influence) + outside sources (external pressure or events).

This confirms that negativity is driven by both contagion and external input, validating the structure observed in the data.

# Part 2: Negativity Spreading – Study of Correlations

In this section, we explore how negativity spreads across Reddit by analyzing its evolution over time and identifying significant peaks of hostility. By studying these waves of negativity, we can uncover how negativity accumulates within clusters and identify which subreddits drive these negative trends.

We begin by examining the overall evolution of negativity over weekly bins, followed by a closer look at significant peaks and the main sources of negativity during these peaks. Statistical analysis will help us quantify the intensity of these spikes and understand their causes.

## Finding waves of negativity
To understand how negativity spreads across time, we first track the overall evolution of negative links across Reddit. This allows us to visualize waves of negativity — periods where hostility increases significantly. We then break this evolution into weekly bins to better understand the temporal spread of negativity.

We aggregated negative links into weekly bins and plotted their evolution over time. This allows us to identify periods of increased hostility, and examine how these waves of negativity evolve across subreddits and clusters.

## Identifying significant peaks
After identifying the overall evolution of negativity, we now focus on identifying significant peaks of hostility. These peaks indicate when negative interactions reached their highest levels, often tied to specific events or discussions on Reddit.

We examined the negativity ratio (the proportion of negative links relative to total links) over time and identified the most significant peaks in the data. By identifying these peaks, we can focus on the periods when negativity was at its highest, and analyze how they relate to real-world events or specific subreddit activities.

## Statistical analysis of negativity peaks
In this section, we conduct a statistical analysis of the identified negativity peaks to quantify the intensity and duration of these events. This analysis helps us understand how significant the peaks are in comparison to normal activity, and whether they deviate significantly from the average levels of negativity.

We used statistical tests to determine the significance of negativity peaks. By comparing the peak negativity levels with the mean negativity in the dataset, we can assess how extreme these spikes are. We also calculated the duration of each peak to see how long these bursts of negativity persist.

## Identifying Main Sources of Negativity During Peaks
In this final section of the analysis, we identify which subreddits or clusters were the main sources of negativity during the identified peaks. By understanding where negativity originates, we can target high-impact subreddits that drive most of the hostility.

We looked at the top subreddits responsible for the highest levels of negative interactions during the significant peaks. This was done by calculating the outgoing negative links from each subreddit during these times and identifying which subreddits contributed the most to the overall increase in negativity.

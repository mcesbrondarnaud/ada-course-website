Lisa stands in the center of the **War Room**, the hum of servers vibrating through the floor. On the main screen, a jagged red line is spiking vertically.

*"Incoming wave,"* she announces, her voice calm but tight. *"Hostility levels at 300% and rising."*

Lisa isn't a soldier; she is the Head Moderator of r/Utopia. For years, she built her community like a garden—pruning spam and banning weeds. But today, the garden is being trampled. A brigade from a rival community has breached the gates.

She turns to her tactical team, the **ADAvengers**. *"Who is it this time? Is this a random troll attack?"*

*"It is never random, Commander,"* the lead analyst replies. *"And honestly? It’s probably the same people as last time."*

The analyst pulls up the historical archives. *"We analyzed years of Reddit conflict. We expected to see chaos. Instead, we found a monopoly."*

The visualization below tracks the **accumulated hostility** sent by Reddit's top 5 subreddits versus the average of the other top 45.

"So the enemy is entrenched," Lisa says. *"We aren't fighting a mob. We are fighting an institution."*

## Main sources of negativity: identifying spreaders

To better understand the dynamics of negativity during peaks, we first focus on identifying the main actors involved when hostility intensifies.
Using the peak periods detected in the notebook, we analyze which clusters and subreddits contribute most to negative links during these time windows.


## Recurring clusters during negativity peaks

A first observation from the peak-level analysis is that the same clusters repeatedly appear among the most negative during peaks.
When aggregating negative links by cluster during peak weeks, a small subset of clusters consistently accounts for a large share of negative interactions.

This recurrence suggests that negativity waves are not driven by a constantly changing set of communities, but instead involve stable, recurrent actors.

Key takeaway
The same clusters repeatedly dominate negativity during peaks, but they are not always the origin of hostility.
Instead, the notebook analysis shows that they act primarily as spreaders, amplifying and propagating negativity once a wave has been triggered by a smaller set of source subreddits.

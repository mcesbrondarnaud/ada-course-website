# Chapter II - Overall Negativity View: Routes & Main Conflicts

The room is quiet as the analyst brings up the next layer of data.

*“We know where they live,”* Lisa says. *“But who is actually shooting at us?”*

The analyst nods.

*“To answer that, we have to start before open conflict. Hostility leaves footprints long before it explodes.”*

### Background Hostility: The Constant Pressure
The first charts appear.

*“These are negative links, not conflicts,”* the analyst says immediately.

*“Think of this as the ambient hostility of Reddit.”*

Lisa scans the pies.

*“So some communities mostly fight themselves.”*

*“Yes. Gaming and Sports argue internally. Their negativity circulates inside, they are in a civil war.”*

*“And others?”*

*“Lifestyle and Entertainment are the opposite. They receive negativity, but generate very little internally.”*

He pauses, then adds:

*“And then there are Politics and Informative.”*

Lisa doesn’t need the explanation.

*“They do both.”*

*“Exactly. They are tense internally and export hostility outward.”* <br><br><br>


### Where Hostility Travels

The pies transition into a chord diagram.

*“Now we remove internal negativity entirely,”* the analyst says. *“This shows only hostility between clusters, without any notion of escalation.”*

Lisa traces the thick arcs.

*“Same hubs again.”*

*“Yes. Even at this stage, negativity is already structured.”*

He continues:
- Most clusters barely interact negatively at all.
- A small number of routes dominate.
- Informative and Politics connect to almost everyone.

*“This tells us something important,”* he says. *“Conflicts don’t appear randomly. They grow along pre-existing hostility highways.”*<br><br><br>


### Who Dominates the Noise Over Time

Before Lisa can reply, the analyst brings up the next figure.

*“This is still not conflict,”* he says. *“This is hostility volume over time.”*

<iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26805661/embed" title="Monthly negativity ratios by cluster" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;"> </iframe> Despite fluctuations, this confirms that Politics and Informative remain top actors throughout.

The bars race forward.

Lisa watches the leaders swap, then settle.

*“They keep coming back,”* she murmurs.

*“Yes,”* the analyst replies. *“Over the entire timeline, Informative and Politics consistently dominate hostility output.”*

Other clusters spike occasionally, like Gaming, Entertainment or Lifestyle but never sustain dominance.

*“This confirms what we suspected,”* he adds.

*“Hostility is not evenly distributed in time either. A few clusters are persistently loud.”*

Lisa looks up.

*“So now we know who’s shouting. When does shouting turn into fighting?”*

The analyst clicks.


### From Hostility to Conflict
*“Here is where the definition changes,”* he says.

*“Conflicts are detected at the subreddit-pair level using peak detection. Only bursts of unusually high negative activity count : escalation, not background noise.”*

Lisa nods.

*“And then you aggregate.”*

*“Yes. Detection is fine-grained, interpretation is at the cluster level.”*<br><br><br>


### The Conflict Network

The screen redraws into a directed graph.

*“This,”* the analyst says, *“is conflict.”*

Lisa immediately notices the difference.

*“Fewer links.”*

*“Exactly. Conflict is rarer, sharper, and directional.”*

Informative and Politics dominate as sources, but they also receive substantial incoming conflict.
Other clusters appear mostly as targets.

*“This is no longer just noise,” he says.*

*“These are recurrent confrontations.”*

He gestures to the major conflict pairs.

“A handful of cluster pairs explain a large fraction of all conflicts. The same battles repeat.”<br><br><br>


### Who Starts the Fights

The next chart simplifies everything.

Lisa doesn’t wait.

*“Same two.”*

<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26800720/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe>

*“Yes. Across time, Informative initiates the most conflicts, followed closely by Politics.”*

All other clusters contribute marginally.


*“This confirms something crucial,”* the analyst says.

*“The clusters that dominate hostility are also the ones that escalate it. These are the ones we need to be really careful about, they are the main fighters.”*<br><br><br>

### Who Bears the Cost

The final figures appear together.

*“Now we look at roles,”* the analyst explains.

*“Who fights internally, who attacks, and who gets attacked.”*

<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/26805809/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe>

The imbalance is clear:
- Lifestyle, Entertainment, Technology, Sports absorb a large share of incoming conflicts.
- Informative and Politics dominate outgoing and internal conflicts.
- Some clusters are absent entirely,  too small or isolated to be pulled in.

Lisa exhales.

*“That’s not symmetric conflict.”*

*“No,”* he agrees.

*“It’s a structural asymmetry. The ‘soft’ communities appear far more often as victims than as attackers,” the analyst says. “In contrast, the most conflictual and controversial clusters generate a disproportionate share of outgoing conflicts.”*

He pauses, then adds, *“Informative and Politics clearly stand out here. They behave like structural bullies in the system.”*

Lisa frowns. *“Then we need to be careful.”*
*“Maybe,”* he replies. *“Their strong ideological divisions also mean they spend a lot of energy fighting among themselves. If we’re lucky, they’ll stay busy tearing each other apart.”*<br><br><br>


### What We Learn
Lisa steps back from the screens.

*“So hostility sets the stage. A few clusters dominate the noise. And when things escalate, it’s the same actors, hitting the same targets.”*

The analyst nods.

*“Exactly. Negativity creates pressure. Conflict is where it finally ruptures.”*

Lisa looks toward the next set of dashboards.

*“And now,”* she says quietly, *“I want to understand why some weeks explode… and others don’t.”*

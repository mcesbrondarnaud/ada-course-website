# Chapter II: Overview of Negativity (Routes & Conflicts)
The room is quiet as the analyst brings up the next layer of data.

*"We know where they live,"* Lisa says. *"But who is actually shooting at us?"
"You might expect Gaming or Sports to dominate," the analyst says. "You’d be wrong."*

The chart below shows the accumulated monthly share of negative interactions sent by Reddit’s major clusters, **normalized** by their overall activity. This distinguishes between communities that are just "loud" and those that are disproportionately hostile.

**The Insight:** The war for Reddit is dominated by the **Politics** and **Informative** clusters. These superpowers maintain a near-constant barrage of negativity, dwarfing other communities.
"Okay, so they generate the hate," Lisa asks. "But where does it go? Is it internal drama or an invasion?"
The analyst switches to the Conflict Distribution Chart.

The Analysis: This is the "Aggression Ratio."
Internal Conflict (Civil War): Some clusters, like Gaming, spend a huge amount of energy fighting within their own subreddits.
Outgoing Conflict (The Crusade): Others, particularly the Informative and Political clusters, export their hostility. They are relatively peaceful at home, but aggressively target outsiders.
"Too much noise," Lisa mutters. "Show me the super-highways. Who attacks whom?"
The analyst illuminates the Global Flow of Negativity.

The Analysis: Now the picture is clear. The war isn't "Everyone vs. Everyone." It is highly concentrated along specific "Trade Routes" of hate.
The Rivalries: We see massive pipes of hostility flowing between specific ideological opponents (e.g., Politics Left vs. Politics Right).
The Collateral Damage: We see the "Bully Routes"—large clusters raining negativity down on smaller, unrelated clusters.

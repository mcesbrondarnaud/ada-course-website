# III. 🔥 Echo Chambers or Coincidence? Do Sources Actually Activate Neighbors?
Being present during an attack doesn’t mean being influenced by it. 			   
To test whether negativity truly spreads, rather than just randomly fluctuates, we analyze whether:	 
- neighbors increase their own negative activity after being targeted,
- repeated exposure leads to measurable escalation,
- and activation patterns align temporally with source behavior.
Let’s see if neighbors are in fact influenced by sources:

There is a significant boost in neighbor-to-neighbors negativity during the peak after they are tagged by sources. This suggests that during waves, echochambers of negativity emerge around main spreaders (‘sources’)..

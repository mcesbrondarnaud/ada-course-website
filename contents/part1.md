## Origins and Concentration of negativity 
## Part 1 - Cluster Landscape : Understanding the thematic structure of Reddit

Before analyzing negativity, we must first understand the thematic structure of Reddit. Subreddits form communities organized around topics such as politics, gaming, entertainment, or technology.
By mapping these communities, we build the foundation needed to interpret where negativity originates and how it spreads.

Reddit is not a uniform space. Subreddits naturally group into thematic clusters, and these clusters influence behavior.
Negativity is unlikely to be random — instead, it tends to emerge from and propagate through specific topical communities.

Understanding this structure helps us answer:
- Which subreddits are the primary sources of negative references?
- Are certain thematic clusters (political, cultural, entertainment etc...) more prone to initiate hostility?
- Is negativity evenly distributed or concentrated in a few communities?
- Can we quantify this inequality (using a Gini coefficient)?

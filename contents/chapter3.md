# Chapter III — Waves of Negativity & Echo Chambers

Lisa stays in front of the main screen.

*“We’ve mapped the routes,”* she says. *“We know who generates hostility and who escalates it into conflict. But it still doesn’t explain when things blow up.”*

The analyst nods.

*“Exactly. Negativity isn’t constant. It comes in waves.”*

### A Persistent Gap

> We detect 21 spikes of negativity looking at the evolution of the ratio per week.

The first figure fills the screen: three curves, steady, separated.

*“This is where we have to start,”* the analyst says. *“Not with spikes. With baseline behavior.”*

He points to the lines. 
- Sources are consistently the most negative.
- Recurrent neighbors follow, clearly above average.
- Others remain flat and low.

Lisa watches the curves evolve.

*“They don’t cross.”*

*“No,”* he replies. *“And that’s the key insight. Even outside major events, these groups behave differently.”*

He adds: *“This tells us something fundamental: before any wave, before any conflict, the system already contains a polarized core.”*

Lisa exhales slowly.

*“So waves don’t create hostility.”*

*“They reveal it.”*<br><br><br>


### The Same Ordering, Event After Event

The next chart replaces trajectories with distributions.

*“This figure aggregates across events,”* the analyst explains. *“It asks a simple question: does this separation hold consistently?”*

Lisa doesn’t hesitate.

*“Yes. Sources dominate. Neighbors are in between. Others trail far behind.”*

*“Exactly,”* he says. *“The distributions barely overlap.”*

This rules out coincidence.

*“The gap isn’t driven by a few extreme events,”* he continues. *“It’s a structural property of how these communities interact.”*

Lisa tilts her head.

*“So when a wave happens…”*

*“…it happens inside an already polarized structure,”* he finishes.<br><br><br>


### What Changes When a Source Ignites

The analyst switches to the next set of plots.

*“Now we look at change, not level,”* he says.

The before–after comparison is stark.

*“When a source becomes active,”* he explains, *“neighbor-to-neighbor interactions grow significantly more negative.”*

Lisa leans forward.

*“So neighbors don’t just absorb negativity from the source.”*

*“No,”* he replies. *“They start talking to each other — and reinforcing it.”*

He taps the histogram.

*“The shift is systematic. The average change is positive across events.”*

Lisa nods.

*“This is the moment echo chambers switch on.”*<br><br><br>

### Who Dominates the Emotional Load

The analyst zooms out to compare interaction types.

*“Here’s the hierarchy during waves,”* he says.
- Source → Neighbor links are the most negative.
- Neighbor → Neighbor links follow closely.
- All other interactions are far lower — despite being far more numerous.

Lisa frowns.

*“So the most toxic conversations aren’t the most common ones.”*

*“Exactly,”* he says. *“Echo chambers are small but intense.”*<br><br><br>


### Are Waves Reusing the Same Cast?

Two heatmaps appear.

*“These measure similarity across different waves,”* the analyst explains. *“Do we see the same actors coming back?”*

Lisa scans the matrices.

*“Sources are extremely stable.”*

*“Yes. The same communities repeatedly ignite waves.”*

*“And neighbors?”*

*“More flexible, but still far from random.”*

He adds: *“This means waves aren’t isolated accidents. They are recurrent mobilizations of the same groups.”*

Lisa sighs.

*“So we’re not chasing ghosts.”*

*“No,”* he replies. *“We’re observing a system with memory.”*<br><br><br>


### Where Echo Chambers Live

The embedding map from Chapter I returns — now animated (and adding a few points for the others).

*“Each dot is a community,”* the analyst says. *“Color indicates its role during a wave.”*

Lisa watches clusters light up together.

*“They’re close.”*

*“Yes,”* he replies. *“Sources and neighbors occupy the same regions of the space.”*

He pauses the animation.

*“This confirms that echo chambers are not abstract. They are anchored in Reddit’s structural geography.”*<br><br><br>


### The Amplifiers

The final figure isolates a small subset of communities.

*“These are the amplifiers,”* the analyst explains. *“Clusters that repeatedly appear as sources, we can even call them super spreaders.”*

Lisa isn’t surprised.

*“Same ideological zones again.”*

*“Yes,”* he says. *“They don’t just participate in waves. They shape their intensity and reach.”*<br><br><br>


### What Chapter III Tells Us

Lisa steps back from the screens.

*“So let me summarize,”* she says. *“Negativity doesn’t suddenly emerge. It sits in a polarized core. Waves activate it. Echo chambers amplify it. And the same actors keep reappearing.”*

The analyst nods.

*“Exactly. The structure comes first. The wave is just the trigger.”*

Lisa looks toward the next dashboard.

*“Then the real question is obvious.”* She pauses. *“What pulls the trigger in the first place?”*

The analyst turns to the final set of files.

*“That’s what Chapter IV is about.”*

[eg de chat]

It starts with a simple post.

You share an opinion on Reddit — nothing outrageous, just a thought.
Within minutes, replies appear. Some disagree. Then the tone shifts. Comments become sharper. Users from other subreddits jump in. Links start flying. Suddenly, the discussion no longer feels like a debate, but like a wave of hostility you didn’t see coming.

You close your laptop and wonder:
Why did this escalate so fast?
Was it something I said — or something about where I posted it?
And why did it spread beyond the original community?

This experience is not unique. On large online platforms, negativity often seems to emerge suddenly, spread rapidly, and concentrate around certain communities. Yet despite how common this phenomenon is, it is rarely understood as a collective, network-driven process.

In this project, we take a step back from individual posts and users to study negativity at the community level. Using millions of inter-subreddit links on Reddit, we ask a simple but powerful question:

> How does negativity emerge, spread, and evolve across interconnected online communities?

By combining network analysis, semantic clustering, and temporal modeling, we show that negativity is not random, nor evenly distributed. Instead, it is driven by a small number of influential communities, amplified through network connections, and shaped by both internal dynamics and external events.

Understanding these mechanisms is a first step toward a more constructive online space — not by silencing disagreement, but by recognizing how and where negativity gains momentum.
